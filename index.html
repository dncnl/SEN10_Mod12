        <h2>Why the Design Looks “Ugly” (On Purpose)</h2>
        <p>
            The Yale School of Art’s official website is a famous example of <strong>brutalist web design</strong>. 
            It embraces raw structure, clashing colors, and minimal visual polish to make a philosophical statement about 
            <em>function, authorship, and artistic experimentation</em>.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brutalist Aesthetic:</strong> Harsh color contrasts, oversized elements, and minimal alignment challenge modern design conventions.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Editing:</strong> The site functions like a wiki—any member of the Yale art community can edit or add content, leading to inconsistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophical Expression:</strong> The chaotic appearance is a deliberate act of rebellion against corporate and polished UI design.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-Tech Authenticity:</strong> Built with basic HTML and CSS, the design highlights transparency and accessibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Could Be Improved</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Adopt a consistent, neutral color palette for readability.</li>
            <li>Use clear typography and establish visual hierarchy.</li>
            <li>Apply spacing and grid layouts for structure and flow.</li>
            <li>Ensure responsive design across devices.</li>
            <li>Add subtle animations or transitions for a polished feel.</li>
        </ul>

            Despite its seemingly “ugly” interface, the Yale School of Art website is a bold artistic statement about 
            digital self-expression. It reminds designers that <strong>web design can be both art and communication</strong>, 
            and that beauty in design is often defined by purpose.
